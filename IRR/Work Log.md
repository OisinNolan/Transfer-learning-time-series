* Read + understand shapelets paper
* Look at existing surveys on TSC: what _exactly_ is being compared across models? Can I add to this in terms of what properties we compare and which model types?
* Start to fill out a spreadsheet with the models I have so far and think about the properties to compare.

**31/12/2021**
* Read lafabregue, note what it does that I want to do, and what it doesn't. Same with fawaz and other 'review' type papers.
* Then take stock of the models I've review so far and see how I can compare them, and what other models might make sense to include too.

**01/01/2022**
* Read FCN paper -> this model is used for transfer in 2 papers.
* Write down model traits and start drafting up sections... see what else needs to be read
	- Think about how to compare performance  of _transfer_ stuff
	- Think about how to compare model characteristics -- taxonomy stuff :)
	- Which models handle uni / multivariate data?
	- Start writing draft plan
		- Think about which points I want to make, how they're backed up, how they answer the research questions, and logical flow
		- Determine if I need to include COTE / NN DTW

**02/01/2022**
- Make a W/L/T table for the 4 (3?) models I have data on (in their pre-trained states). Make the argument that for a true comparison of the potential of these models, we'd need to have the same sources.

**03/01/2022**
- Investigate the effects of [[franceschi_2020]] using fordA as a source with reference to [[fawaz_2018]].
- Start writing out the points for the lit review, and how each paper connects to the next. Also decide which _order_ to write in, (as topological as possible?)

**04/01/2022**
- Read review papers on transfer learning and TSC to get good motivations for intro
- Bullet out the rest of intro + background section (all those definitions + decide what's relevant)
- Bullet out the source selection section + see if any other relevant methods
- Try figure out if I have enough _content_ for the main lit review or if I need to find more papers ...

**05/01/2022**
- Get proper set of performance results
- Bullet out remaining sections

**06/01/2022**
- Write draft for Pavlos ASAP

**07/01/2022**
- Fill out bullets for intro & background sections
- Fill out bullets for conclusion
- Proof read, look out for:
	- Does each section contribute to / answer a research question?
	- Does it feel like each research question has been appropriately covered?
	- Am I answering anything else implicitly?
	- Is there enough evaluation & examination of the chosen papers?
- Cross-reference the paper with the rubric + guidelines
