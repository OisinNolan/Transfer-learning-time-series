# Literature Review
#### Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
**Model**
- Proposed by [[wang_2017]], DNN baseline, relatively small (check this) and quick to train
- Just convolutions, batch norm, relus, GAP, and softmax.

**Transfer Learning**
- TL experiments done by [[fawaz_2018]], who tried transferring from each UCR to each other UCR.
