**summary**
* They compare deep encoders in terms of their ability to produce well-formed clusters of datasets
* They introduce a new CAM method for unsupervised case
* They show that these deep clustering models can be composed of 3 blocks, each of which can have a number of different types, which can be permuted together to make different models. They try all the combinations and see what works.
* Section 2.2 motivates DNNs for feature-learning
* They evaluate how good the clusters themselves are.
