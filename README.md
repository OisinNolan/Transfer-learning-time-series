# Transfer-learning-time-series
* Notes from a literature review on transfer learning in time series classification. This review was done for the [Informatics Research Review](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cxinfr11136.htm) module I took at UoE.
* The IRR folder at root is an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. I would recommend viewing the `.md` files via obsidian as they contain some obsidian-specific [file linking syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link).
* The repo contains papers in PDF form and corresponding notes in `.md` files.
